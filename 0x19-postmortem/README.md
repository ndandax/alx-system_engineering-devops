Outage Postmortem: Service Degradation on VisualNdandax Platform

Issue Summary:
Duration: August 8, 2023, 14:30 UTC to August 9, 2023, 02:45 UTC
Impact: VisualNdandax Platform experienced intermittent service degradation, resulting in slow response times and heightened error rates. Approximately 35% of users encountered disruptions during the peak hours.

Timeline:

    August 8, 2023, 14:30 UTC: Anomalies detected via monitoring alerts, signaling elevated error rates.
    August 8, 2023, 14:45 UTC: Engineering team commenced investigation, initially suspecting database performance issues.
    August 8, 2023, 15:15 UTC: Database query optimization attempted, yet performance did not recover.
    August 8, 2023, 16:00 UTC: Focus transitioned to network infrastructure due to peculiar network traffic patterns.
    August 8, 2023, 18:30 UTC: Network assessment revealed no abnormalities; investigation persisted.
    August 9, 2023, 00:00 UTC: Incident escalated to senior engineers for advanced analysis.
    August 9, 2023, 01:30 UTC: Root cause pinpointed as an undetected memory leak in the VisualAuth microservice.
    August 9, 2023, 02:45 UTC: Issue resolved by restarting the affected microservice.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The service degradation stemmed from an undetected memory leak within the VisualAuth microservice, responsible for user authentication and session management. Gradual memory consumption led to resource exhaustion and overall system performance deterioration.

Resolution: The issue was addressed by restarting the VisualAuth microservice, effectively releasing consumed memory and restoring regular service functionality. Additionally, a permanent solution was implemented to proactively identify and rectify memory leaks.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Enhanced Monitoring: Augment monitoring capabilities to encompass memory utilization, error rates, and resource allocation for early anomaly identification.
    Mandatory Code Reviews: Establish mandatory peer code reviews to identify and rectify potential memory leaks during the development lifecycle.
    Automated Testing: Integrate automated memory profiling and load testing into the CI/CD pipeline to preemptively uncover and address memory-related issues prior to deployment.
    Containerization Strategy: Explore containerization strategies to isolate services and facilitate dynamic scaling, diminishing the impact of memory leaks on the system.
    Incident Response Protocol: Formulate a comprehensive incident response protocol detailing escalation procedures, roles, and responsibilities to expedite issue resolution.

Conclusion:
The recent service degradation on the VisualNdandax Platform was attributed to an undetected memory leak within the VisualAuth microservice, affecting user authentication and session management. This incident underscored the significance of robust monitoring, proactive code reviews, and automated testing. While a temporary resolution was achieved through microservice restart, a lasting remedy was enforced to forestall future incidents. By incorporating these corrective and preventative actions, our aim is to heighten the platform's resilience and offer users a more dependable experience.
